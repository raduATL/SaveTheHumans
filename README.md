# SaveTheHumans
save our humans
This little exercise from "Head First C#" A brain-friendly guide by Andrew Stellman and Jennifer Greene is just simply
awesome. It teaches some basic fundamental things about WPF. Click and hold the human, which first appears in the upper left corner
(white rectangle) and move it to the target portal before the timer expires. Once you made it, the portal resets with another location, and you have to drag the human
to the new target portal, but make sure you avoid THE ALIENS !!!! Fun Game. 
Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 was the dev tool used.
